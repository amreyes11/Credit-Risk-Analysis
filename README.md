# Credit-Risk-Analysis




DELIVERABLES

This new assignment consists of three technical analysis deliverables and a written report.

Deliverable 1: Use Resampling Models to Predict Credit Risk
Deliverable 2: Use the SMOTEENN Algorithm to Predict Credit Risk
Deliverable 3: Use Ensemble Classifiers to Predict Credit Risk
Deliverable 4: A Written Report on the Credit Risk Analysis README.md


Deliverable 1: Use Resampling Models to Predict Credit Risk

Using your knowledge of the imbalanced-learn and scikit-learn libraries, you’ll evaluate three machine learning models by using resampling to determine which is better at predicting credit risk. First, you’ll use the oversampling RandomOverSampler and SMOTE algorithms, and then you’ll use the undersampling ClusterCentroids algorithm. Using these algorithms, you’ll resample the dataset, view the count of the target classes, train a logistic regression classifier, calculate the balanced accuracy score, generate a confusion matrix, and generate a classification report.


Deliverable 2: Use the SMOTEENN algorithm to Predict Credit Risk

Using your knowledge of the imbalanced-learn and scikit-learn libraries, you’ll use a combinatorial approach of over- and undersampling with the SMOTEENN algorithm to determine if the results from the combinatorial approach are better at predicting credit risk than the resampling algorithms from Deliverable 1. Using the SMOTEENN algorithm, you’ll resample the dataset, view the count of the target classes, train a logistic regression classifier, calculate the balanced accuracy score, generate a confusion matrix, and generate a classification report.

Deliverable 3: Use Ensemble Classifiers to Predict Credit Risk

Using your knowledge of the imblearn.ensemble library, you’ll train and compare two different ensemble classifiers, BalancedRandomForestClassifier and EasyEnsembleClassifier, to predict credit risk and evaluate each model. Using both algorithms, you’ll resample the dataset, view the count of the target classes, train the ensemble classifier, calculate the balanced accuracy score, generate a confusion matrix, and generate a classification report.
